# ansible-personal

Ansible playbooks I use for provisioning my computers.

## How to install and provision a machine from this repository?

To automatically clone this repository, install Ansible, and execute the playbook, run this one-liner:
```bash
wget -O - https://github.com/jack1142/ansible-personal/raw/main/download.sh | bash
```

In future, to provision the machine, run:
```bash
~/ansible-personal/provision.sh
```
